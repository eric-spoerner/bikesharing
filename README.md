# Bikesharing System Analysis

## Project description

The purpose of this analysis is to understand trends with the current CitiBike platform, currently used in New York City (specifically Manhattan, along with parts of Brooklyn and Queens).  The analysis is intended to be leveraged for the purposes of potentially launching a new bikeshare network in another smaller metro area (Des Moines, IA).

## Tools

* Tableau Public
* Jupyter Lab
* Python, Pandas
